I am a computational social scientist and quantitative health geographer. My work is at the intersection of social demography and population health. I am trained in statistical demography, quantitative research methods, spatial statistical methods, and social and political theory, including the social determinants of health and health geography. My research focuses on the social and political ecologies of human health: the ways informal sociopolitical structures and formal governance and policy interact with lived environments and population characteristics, and how these drive or contribute to behaviours or scenarios that aggregate to population-level health phenomena. I am particularly interested in social and health inequalities, spatial statistical methods, and producing social science research to help public health practitioners improve population health outcomes.


Currently, I am a [Doctoral Candidate (PhC)](https://geography.washington.edu/people/aja-sutton) in the Department of Geography at the University of Washington (UW). My doctoral committee consists of Dr. [Jonathan Mayer](https://geography.washington.edu/people/jonathan-mayer) (Professor Emeritus of Geography, and committee chair); [Dr. Zack W. Almquist](http://depts.washington.edu/zalmquist/) (Associated Professor of Sociology); [Dr. Mark Ellis](http://faculty.washington.edu/ellism/) (Professor of Geography, and Director of the Northwest Federal Statistical Research Data Center); and [Dr. Suzanne Davies Withers](https://sites.uw.edu/swithers/) (Associate Professor of Geography). I aim to complete my doctoral program by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year.


I recently completed a two-year [TADA-BSSR NIH](https://obssr.od.nih.gov/news-and-events/news/director-voice/obssr-launches-training-advanced-data-and-analytics-behavioral) [T32 Fellowship in Data Science and Demography at UW's Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/training/fellowship-funding/data-science-demography-population-health-training/). My faculty mentors were Dr. Almquist and [Dr. Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/) (Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics). I remain a [CSDE Trainee in Demographic Methods](https://csde.washington.edu/training/demographic-certificate/).


I am the Managing Editor of the Population Dynamics Lab, a new and soon to be released publication venue and virtual lab experience for short quantitative, computational and methodological insights, as well as for developing and sharing tools for the field of demography, Edited by [Dr. Sara Curran](https://sites.uw.edu/scurran/) (Professor of Sociology, Director of CSDE, and Editor-in-Chief of [Demography](https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography)).



My **research interests** include: population health, demography, political ecology of health, geospatial methods, social & health inequity, COVID-19, (re)emerging infectious disease, antimicrobial resistance, and climate migration.


## Dissertation Research

 My doctoral research takes a population-level systems perspective on health outcomes and behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US). My first paper examines the roles of political identity and especially presidential candidate preference in the response to COVID-19 and mask-wearing behaviour. My second paper explores using spatial statistical methods to improve multilevel modelling and poststratification for adjustment of non-representativeness in subnational survey data and small area estimation. My third project will consider the relationship between sociopolitical structures, regional COVID-19 policies, and mask-wearing across the US over time.
